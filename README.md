## About Palisadoes

The [Palisadoes Foundationâ€™s](https://www.palisadoes.org) open-source software projects started in 2016 when a group of expatriate Jamaicans wanted to assist development of new and existing information technologies for the islandâ€™s social good. 

Over the years the scope of our work has expanded. Our volunteers now live in all timezones of the globe and work on projects with a truly international scope.
